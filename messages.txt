AGENT!
Coulson has been compromised and we suspect he is an LMD! 
You must find a way to stop him before he can get his hands on the Darkhold! Luckily, I was able to hide it before Coulson could stop me. 
You must retrieve it before he can escape with it! Robbie will point you in the right direction.
Be careful though, we believe there is a Hydra agent on site as well!
PS. Thought you could use some heavier firepower

Dear Agent,
I am Prince Akeem Joffer, of the Kingdom of Zamunda.
Rebels have capturd my father and are demanding a ransom of 20 million dollars! 
I thought S.H.E.L.D. would be able to help me. Most of my funds are stashed in banks in the carribeen,
so I am unable to access it right now beacuze of the currnt coo. 
I am in need $1000 to be able to transfer the money out to pay the ransom. If you are able to wire me that money,
after I receive the rest of my funds, I will handsomly reward you! Attached is the address to send the money too.
Please respond quickly as my fathers life is in the balance!!!
